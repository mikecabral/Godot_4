## Introduction

Active Ragdolls in 3D for Godot 4.5...

I don't see any tutorials on how to do this online for 3D.. so it took me a little while to figure out.

### How to Use

1. Remember to get a working ragdoll that just drops in place properly going FIRST...

2. USE THE PhysicalBoneSimulator3D!!

2. When full ragdoll mode is enabled the interpolated mesh gets hidden and shows the physics mesh. (that's the only way i figured out how to do it). Bones twisting was insane because of constraints to make the realistic ragdoll.
