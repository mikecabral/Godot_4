## Introduction

Active Ragdolls in 3D for Godot 4.5...

I don't see any tutorials on how to do this online for 3D.. so it took me a little while to figure out.

### How to Use

1. Remember to get a working ragdoll that just drops in place properly going FIRST...

2. USE THE PhysicalBoneSimulator3D!!
